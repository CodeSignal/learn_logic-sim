  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Logic Circuit Lab is a drag-and-drop playground for experimenting with digital logic right inside your browser. Build combinational circuits, see how signals move through each gate, and share the results with classmates or teammates.</p>
</section>

<section id="getting-started">
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the <strong>Circuit Elements</strong> palette and drag any gate onto the grid, or click a tile to drop it into the center of the canvas.</li>
    <li>Add <strong>Input</strong> and <strong>Output</strong> blocks so your circuit has places to send and receive signals.</li>
    <li>Connect components by clicking a gate’s output port and then the destination input port. Wires route themselves between the two points.</li>
    <li>Pan the workspace by dragging on empty grid space; use the mouse wheel or trackpad to zoom. The current zoom level appears in the toolbar.</li>
    <li>Click an <strong>Input</strong> block (or press <em>Toggle value</em> in the contextual editor panel) to switch between logic 0 and 1 and watch the circuit update instantly.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>

  <h3>Gate Palette</h3>
  <p>Frequently used gates (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, buffer, etc.) live in the left sidebar. Hover to read a short description or use the search field to jump directly to what you need.</p>

  <h3>Interactive Canvas</h3>
  <p>Place, move, and rotate gates freely across the grid. Wires glow with the accent color whenever a signal is high so you can trace activity at a glance.</p>

  <h3>Automatic Persistence</h3>
  <p>The canvas saves itself after each change. Keep an eye on the status pill in the header for messages such as “Saving…” and “Changes saved”.</p>

  <h3>Exports &amp; Sharing</h3>
  <p>Use the <em>Export VHDL</em> action to create a VHDL snapshot of your current circuit. When the export finishes you’ll see a confirmation toast along with any warnings from the report.</p>

<section id="workflow">
  <h2>Workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Plan</strong>: Sketch the circuit on paper or in the palette preview and note how many inputs and outputs you need.</li>
    <li><strong>Place</strong>: Drag the required gates to the canvas and arrange them so related blocks sit near each other.</li>
    <li><strong>Wire</strong>: Click an output hub and then the destination input. Click an occupied input hub to remove or reroute its connection.</li>
    <li><strong>Verify</strong>: Step through test cases by toggling input blocks.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Tips &amp; Best Practices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use <em>Reset</em> whenever you want to return to the starter layout loaded on first launch.</li>
    <li>Press <kbd>Delete</kbd> with a gate selected to remove it without leaving the keyboard.</li>
    <li>Name inputs and outputs (right-click to open the contextual editor panel) so exported circuits are easier to read.</li>
    <li>Group related gates close together to keep the auto-routed wires short and legible.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="shortcuts">
  <h2>Shortcuts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ESC</strong> – Cancel a pending wire connection.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> – Remove the currently selected gate.</li>
    <li><strong>Click + Drag</strong> – Move a gate by grabbing the gate symbol.</li>
    <li><strong>Drag empty grid</strong> – Pan the workspace.</li>
    <li><strong>Scroll / Pinch</strong> – Zoom in or out around the cursor.</li>
    <li><strong>Click output, click input</strong> – Create a wire between two components.</li>
    <li><strong>Click input hub</strong> – Remove the attached wire.</li>
    <li><strong>Right-click gate</strong> – Open the contextual editor for naming and quick actions.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="faq">
  <h2>Troubleshooting / FAQ</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Why do I see “Save failed (will retry)”? </summary>
    <p>The browser occasionally blocks local saves (usually because storage is full or disabled). The simulator retries in the background; clearing space or re-enabling storage fixes the warning.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I delete a wire?</summary>
    <p>Click the wire’s destination input hub. Each input accepts only one connection, so removing it frees the port immediately.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>The wires look misaligned after resizing the window.</summary>
    <p>The layout engine recalculates after every resize. If anything still looks off, nudge a gate slightly or press Reset to trigger a clean redraw.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is my work automatically saved?</summary>
    <p>Yes. After every change the header cycles through “Saving…”, “Changes saved”, and finally “Ready”. You can keep building without pressing a save button.</p>
